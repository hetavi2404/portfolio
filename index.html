            <p>
                A computer engineer who had rather solve logic problems than fix button padding and margin. <br>
                Logic, algorithms, and actual problems are what keep me going. <br>
                Still.... I built this portfolio to show I can do both.
                Be gentle, this portfolio is still a work in progress (just like me).

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I’m a second-year Computer Engineering student with a CGPA of 7.71, currently exploring the real world side of what we’re taught in class.  
                I’ve worked with C, C++, HTML, and CSS through hands-on learning at Royal Technosoft.  
                Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my skills in Python, JavaScript, SQL, and Data Structures & Algorithms.
                <br><br>
                I enjoy the kind of programming that actually makes you think — not just follow instructions.  
                I prefer solving logical problems, experimenting with code, and understanding the "why" behind what works.  
                While I’m not obsessed with frontend aesthetics, I do believe clean structure and clarity matter — in both code and presentation.
                <br><br>
                I'm not rushing to chase trends or pretend I know it all.  
                I’m building my foundation the way I like to build my code — step by step, with intention.  
                This portfolio is one of those steps.

                <h3>Hotel Management System (C)</h3>

                <p>This is a console-based hotel booking system developed in C. It allows basic management of hotel rooms and customer interactions such as booking, check-in, check-out, and cancellations. It’s designed as a beginner-level project to demonstrate logic building and use of arrays, conditionals, and basic I/O operations.</p>

                <p>This portfolio itself is a project — built to show that while I enjoy working with logic-heavy languages like C++ and Python, I can still put together something clean and functional on the web when needed. It’s simple, personal, and a space to share what I’ve created so far.</p>
