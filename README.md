# Hetavi Makwana — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website!  
This project was built from scratch using only HTML and CSS (no frameworks), just vibes and a bit of chaos.

## Live Site
https://hetavi2404.github.io/portfolio/

## About the Project

This portfolio showcases:

- Who I am
- What I'm learning and working on
- A few projects I've built using C, C++, and other tools
- A simple contact form (powered by Formspree)

It's designed to be clean, straightforward, and a little bit real.  
While I’m more into programming logic than pixel perfection, this site was my attempt to blend both.

## Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Formspree (for contact form)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Folder Structure

portfolio/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── README.md

## Features

- Fixed sidebar navigation
- Hero + About + Projects + Contact + Footer sections
- Clean responsive layout
- Contact form with Formspree integration

## Final Note

Still a work in progress — just like me.  
Thanks for checking it out.
